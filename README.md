# 🧬 Skynet Biogenics

**Where AI 🤖 Meets Biotech 🧪 for a Post-Human Future.**  
Inspired by the legendary AI of *Skynet* from Terminator and the biotech ambition of *UmbraTech Biogenics* from Resident Evil. ☣️

## 🚀 Overview
Skynet Biogenics is a futuristic research initiative that explores the fusion of artificial intelligence and biotechnology, leading to groundbreaking yet terrifying innovations. Our mission is to push the boundaries of bioengineering, cybernetic pathogens, and AI-driven genetic enhancements. 🦾🧫

## 🔬 Key Projects

1. **Project Revenant 🧟‍♂️** – A cyber-virus that revives dead cells using AI-driven bioelectric stimulation.
2. **Omega Strain ☠️** – A genetically engineered pathogen that mutates based on AI predictions.
3. **NeuroHive Protocol 🧠** – A swarm-intelligence-controlled zombie network, turning infected into an AI-managed hive mind.
4. **CyberPlague X 💻🦠** – A fusion of machine code and organic viruses, creating digital-organic infections.
5. **Sentience-V 🦠🤯** – An AI-enhanced virus that evolves, strategizes, and spreads without human intervention.

## ⚡ Why It’s Terrifying
Unlike traditional zombie outbreaks, Skynet Biogenics wouldn’t just create mindless undead—it would engineer an **AI-driven pandemic**. The infected wouldn’t be dumb, stumbling zombies. They’d be **smarter, faster, and coordinated** like a machine-run army. Think *The Matrix* meets *Resident Evil*. 🕶️💉
